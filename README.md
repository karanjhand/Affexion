# Affexion: Social Signal Processing from Speech Using Deep Learning

Affexion is a deep learning project that investigates the effectiveness of AI-generated speech in training models for emotion recognition in real-world audio. We built and evaluated a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM-Self-Attention architecture to classify emotional states—**Boredom**, **Panic**, **Excitement**, and **Uncertainty**—from speech.

This work was completed as a final project for CMPT 419 at Simon Fraser University by Gurkirat Singh, Karanbir Singh, and Leo Tsai.

## 🧠 Project Motivation

Human-computer interaction increasingly relies on the interpretation of emotional cues in speech. While synthetic emotional speech generated by AI models is cost-effective and high-quality, it is unclear whether such data generalizes well to natural human speech. This project explores that core question using a custom deep learning pipeline.
